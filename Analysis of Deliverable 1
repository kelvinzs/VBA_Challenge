Results of 2017 analysis-
The results returned from refactoring and running the code shows that it takes VBA a total of 0.3330078 to run the analysis for all the 2017 stocks. Attached to this document is the corresponding image titled VBA_Challenge_2017.png

Result of 2018 analysis-
The results returned from refactoring and running the code shows that it takes VBA a total of 0.1884766 to run the analysis for all the 2018 stocks. 

#Summary:
in conclusion the refactored code's performance is appropriate for it's current purposes.  
#Advantages of Refactoring Code:
i) Refactoring code makes the code easier to understand and less complex. 
ii)Refactoring code assists in discovering bugs and improving execution time. 
iii) Refactoring code 

#Disadvantages of Refactoring code: 
i) Refactoring code is time consuming and usually requires high level of expertise or understanding. 
ii) As mentioned previously refactoring code is time consuming and requires a high level of understanding which combined makes refactoring code resource intensive.  

#Comparison between original(yearValueAnalysis) and Refactored VBA script(allstocksanalysis refactored)? 
Advantages:
i) The refactored vba script outperforms the original script with a much shorter execution time. Duration of each script is listed below in seconds(s). 
Original scripts         Duration(s) 
2017 analysis            17898.96
2018 analysis            18120.82

Refactored scripts
2017 analysis            0.3330078
2018 analysis            0.1884766

#Conclusion
In conclusion there is a significant difference in performance between the refactored scripts and the original scripts with the refactored scripts performing faster and more efficiently than the original script.
